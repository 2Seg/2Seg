### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

No inspiration to introduce myself so let's keep the default:

- ğŸ”­ Currently working as a PHP Laravel developer at Linkvalue
- ğŸŒ± Learning how to cope with COVID19 as a digital nomad
- ğŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on any project I could find interesting
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: where I surfed the past few years
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: messenger bird (preferably) or LinkedIn
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: I / You / She.He etc
- âš¡ Fun fact: previous bullet point was funny enough

#### Cheers
